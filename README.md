### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a new born data analyst and I am standing at the precipice of embarking on a new career path in the data world.  
During the DA course, i've studied coding using Python and SQL, statistic and testing hypothesis, creating visualizations in Tableau and telling data based stories.  I've had a lot of practice with the real life related datasets and tasks. I'm interested in people in general as well as what might affect their thoughts, decisions and behavior.   
What makes a business grow, what brings bigger profit, how customers react to new products and how different changes affect customer behavior - i enjoy answering to such questions the most.  

Fields somehow related to traveling, dogs, sustainability, ecology, fashion, self development or psychology get me fired up.
